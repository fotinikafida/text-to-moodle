# text-to-moodle
This is a repository of educational .mbz resources, which can be restored to a Moodle environment. Their name 'text-to-moodle' is because the main process of their development was to transform text files like .docx, .pdf, and plain .ppts  to dynamic items in an LMS environment, using incorporated Moodle authoring tools. 


## 1. 'Application and results of new curricula of arts in real-time-classroom'(moodle lesson-branching scenario)


This learning tool is designed to assist teachers in assessing the implementation of new curricula during their daily teaching and collecting and editing data. It is an interactive open resource created using the Moodle media tool 'Moodle- lesson' in 2021-2022. The tool is a branching scenario-type tool and was developed as part of a MOOC self-paced teacher training program for the New Visual Studies curriculum. This curriculum is designed for middle and high schools in Greece.

The project (MIS) 5035543 was a collaboration between the Institution of Educational Policy of Greece and the drafting group of expert-art-teacher curricula editors, and their supervisors in 2021. The resource has been integrated into the Institution's Information System on a Moodle site, which can be accessed by enrolling in the course.

It is important to note that this assessment is free and not intended to evaluate mastery of the above course. The digital transfer and transformation from text & power-point to-moodle was carried out by Fotini Kafida, under the supervision of the Committee of the MOOC Educational Projects of the Institution of Educational Policy of Greece.
This resource is designed to accompany teachers on their journey of developing and refining their teaching strategies and is a valuable tool for assessing the application of new curricula in actual teaching situations.

Αυτό είναι ένα αποθετήριο εκπαιδευτικών πόρων .mbz, οι οποίοι μπορούν να αποκατασταθούν σε περιβάλλον moodle. Το όνομά τους «κείμενο-σε-moodle» οφείλεται στο γεγονός ότι, η κύρια πρόκληση  ανάπτυξής τους ήταν να μετατραταπούν αρχεία  όπως .docx, .pdf και στατικά .ppts σε δυναμικά στοιχεία σε ένα lms envinronment, χρησιμοποιώντας ενσωματωμένα εργαλεία σύνταξης moodle.
